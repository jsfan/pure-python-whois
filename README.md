pure-python-whois
=================
The aim of this package is to provide a feature-complete pure Python implementation
for whois. While e.g. pywhois comes with a pure Python implementation, it only
uses this implementation as a fallback preferring the system implementation over the
pure Python one. Furthermore, the pure Python implementation is experimental and
rather limited in its features.

The pure-python-whois started as a transliteration of Marco d'Itri's whois
client (written in C) which comes with most Linux distributions. The feature set was
largely transferred and more recent revisions have focused on making the code more
pythonic.

Pull requests welcome.
